Deep learning has substantially improved the capability of face swap algorithms in creating photo-realistic fake facial videos since the emergence of the deepfake two year ago. Deepfake, when being used with malicious intent such as creating fake pornographic videos for celebrities and impersonating political figures, has increased the mistrust in many aspects of our society. Consequently, there is a pressing need for effective methods to detect these deepfake videos and disseminate the results to the general public. In this project, we derive three general principles for choosing effective deepfake detectors in the hope of winning the battle against forgers in the long run. We demonstrate a heart rate detector that fulfills the principles can achieve reasonable detection accuracy for deepfake videos.
